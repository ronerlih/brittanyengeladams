For instance, inviting the public to a special artist talk sessions to discuss and share ideas about the role of art, and performance, welcoming their interpretation of works of art, promoting equality between people and universal access to culture. This discussion addressed topics such as: Are these spaces really open to everyone, or are there people who may feel excluded?
