		blurb: "Forthcoming 'BodyMouth/Ielele' Live in October at The Future Bodies Symposium.Future Bodies will present a constellation of new interdisciplinary research and practice in new media that considers the role of bodies, broadly conceived, in our collective future. As both material and metaphorical entities, bodies are at once subject to historical context and act as agents in forging new horizons of experience. Future Bodies will convene conversations around a set of interrelated questions about how bodies shape and intersect with art, technology, data, ecology, and history. We invite participants to explore how specific bodies, as sites of tension and contestation, are rendered, identified, and understood, and in turn, how they enable us to imagine and instantiate new futures inside and outside of established systems.",

Throughout the film, overlaid on top of Brittany’s hands are the hands behind the datasets used in machine learning to identify and detect hands.",

The body is obscured and is fading as if disintegrating into the background of the scene. (a blending quality as if a statue in ruins) For example, only the sternum and hands would be made visible. This google image, has the general resemblance to the quality of blending, tweaking, and manipulating the visual in different ways.",

In many ways, these online platforms brought more diverse groups from the dance community together, and gave dance institutions the opportunity to ask and receive feedback from the community. For instance, inviting the public to a special artist talk sessions to discuss and share ideas about the role of art, and performance, welcoming their interpretation of works of art, promoting equality between people and universal access to culture. This discussion addressed topics such as: Are these spaces really open to everyone, or are there people who may feel excluded?  Dance institutions and performance venues with free access are more equal? What should Dance institutions be like in the ‘new normal'.",
