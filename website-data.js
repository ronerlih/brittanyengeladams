This formulation is broached in ‘Architecture of Memory,’ where artist Brittany Engel-Adams uses digital art techniques in order to (re)member ancestral performances. By (re)presenting the gestures that were her own necessary precondition, (i.e.those of her relatives) the artist forms a togetherness that transcends the self as a discreetly positioned thing in space-time and (re)supposes a possibility of experience both contingent upon and in excess to the phenomenal and causal.'",
