		blurb: "Forthcoming 'BodyMouth/Ielele' Live in October at The Future Bodies Symposium.Future Bodies will present a constellation of new interdisciplinary research and practice in new media that considers the role of bodies, broadly conceived, in our collective future. As both material and metaphorical entities, bodies are at once subject to historical context and act as agents in forging new horizons of experience. Future Bodies will convene conversations around a set of interrelated questions about how bodies shape and intersect with art, technology, data, ecology, and history. We invite participants to explore how specific bodies, as sites of tension and contestation, are rendered, identified, and understood, and in turn, how they enable us to imagine and instantiate new futures inside and outside of established systems.",
