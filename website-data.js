These movement studies were generated during artist residencies and COVID confinement with my collaborator Ron Erlih. The Kinect detects my body and represents it as a skeletal avatar. The infrared sensor of the kinect  affects my sensorial experience, paradoxically, my skin feels more activated by the process. As a dance teacher I consider the ways this software could be used by students in a dance class. If avatars could offer multi-dimensional feedback or phrasing, instead of a mirror while training? I wonder how that feedback could be effective and productive in learning movement as I'm not relying on ocular relation to create representations, I have to rely on my orientation to motion and the feeling of being in space. It’s a proprioceptive, tactile, and kinesthetic method.'",

In many ways, these online platforms brought more diverse groups from the dance community together, and gave dance institutions the opportunity to ask and receive feedback from the community. For instance, inviting the public to a special artist talk sessions to discuss and share ideas about the role of art, and performance, welcoming their interpretation of works of art, promoting equality between people and universal access to culture. This discussion addressed topics such as: Are these spaces really open to everyone, or are there people who may feel excluded?
