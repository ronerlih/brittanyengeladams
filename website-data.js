Such objects are called projectiles and their path is called a trajectory. The motion of falling objects as discussed in Motion Along a Straight Line is a simple one-dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement. In this section, we consider two-dimensional projectile motion, and our treatment neglects the effects of air resistance.’",

		blurb: "Since the first optical transatlantic cable that went into operation in 1988 - TAT-8 - computers have been sharing datas at the speed of light. Human mind can not. A complete new speed for information. Now occupying drives all over a world that is saying hello, gluttoning energy. Tera after tera, the datas stored become spaces. Linked, potentially compared, pondered, valued, sometimes structured, hierarchised and shared, they are creating a new informational and atmospheric reality. What consciousness will come from this reality? Cloud computing appears as a floating phenomena with a strange and powerful aspect, fitting its name as if it was meant. One can grasp its shape in a totally different way than the nearest one sitting next. Can it be seen as a new common ground, a global informational and shared condition or is the cloud creating a new interface for lifeforms trapping human minds in a game where moves are made at the speed of light'",

Since its discovery, the pineal gland, known by some as the third eye, has been shrouded in mystery. Scientists now know it controls the production of melatonin, playing an important role in modulating circadian rhythms, or the body's internal clock. However, an online search for notes to include in a course she was teaching opened Borjigin's eyes to a thriving community still convinced of the pineal gland's mystical power.",

		blurb: "In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle sets out to examine the nature of happiness. He argues that happiness consists in ‘activity of the soul in accordance with virtue’, for example with moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. The Ethics also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotle’s work has had a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about ethical matters.",

		blurb: "Given the special situation of lockdown experienced in 2020 due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, many wondered,‘Where and how will we gather during a time of confinement?’ Special online platforms where material (videos, ideas for virtual interactive activities, etc.), could be shared with a global audience to engage in performance from home, of course, without forgetting to prioritize inclusion and consider the diversity of their audiences. In many ways, these online platforms brought more diverse groups from the dance community together, and gave dance institutions the opportunity to ask and receive feedback from the community. For instance, inviting the public to a special artist talk sessions to discuss and share ideas about the role of art, and performance, welcoming their interpretation of works of art, promoting equality between people and universal access to culture. This discussion addressed topics such as: Are these spaces really open to everyone, or are there people who may feel excluded?  Dance institutions and performance venues with free access are more equal? What should Dance institutions be like in the ‘new normal'.",
