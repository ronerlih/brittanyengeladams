Such objects are called projectiles and their path is called a trajectory.

The memory does not depend on an electric current to save data, instead, data is written to individual cells using binary code. Random Access Memory, reads and writes memory. Random Access Memory applies to memory learned from experiences. The information is temporarily stored, it erases when you restart or shut down your computer, because the information is stored electrically on transistors. When there is no electrical current, the data disappears.",

The latter is not, however, a purely mental substance that can be defined in terms of thought or consciousness alone, as Descartes claimed. But persons and their bodies have different identity conditions and are both substances, so there are two substances essentially involved in a human being, hence this is a form of substance dualism.",

		blurb: "Since the first optical transatlantic cable that went into operation in 1988 - TAT-8 - computers have been sharing datas at the speed of light. Human mind can not. A complete new speed for information. Now occupying drives all over a world that is saying hello, gluttoning energy. Tera after tera, the datas stored become spaces. Linked, potentially compared, pondered, valued, sometimes structured, hierarchised and shared, they are creating a new informational and atmospheric reality. What consciousness will come from this reality? Cloud computing appears as a floating phenomena with a strange and powerful aspect, fitting its name as if it was meant. One can grasp its shape in a totally different way than the nearest one sitting next. Can it be seen as a new common ground, a global informational and shared condition or is the cloud creating a new interface for lifeforms trapping human minds in a game where moves are made at the speed of light'",

		blurb: "Given the special situation of lockdown experienced in 2020 due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, many wondered,‘Where and how will we gather during a time of confinement?’ Special online platforms where material (videos, ideas for virtual interactive activities, etc.), could be shared with a global audience to engage in performance from home, of course, without forgetting to prioritize inclusion and consider the diversity of their audiences. In many ways, these online platforms brought more diverse groups from the dance community together, and gave dance institutions the opportunity to ask and receive feedback from the community. For instance, inviting the public to a special artist talk sessions to discuss and share ideas about the role of art, and performance, welcoming their interpretation of works of art, promoting equality between people and universal access to culture. This discussion addressed topics such as: Are these spaces really open to everyone, or are there people who may feel excluded?  Dance institutions and performance venues with free access are more equal? What should Dance institutions be like in the ‘new normal'.",

		blurb: "The requisite enzymes for DMT synthesis occur in pineal. If the pineal gland does in fact produce DMT, the next question is whether it plays any kind of role in ‘a potential DMT neurotransmitter system’ that could exist in the body. If there is a DMT neurotransmitter system, and if it regulates our sense of reality, that opens many interesting avenues regarding questions of how biological function (the body) affects the mind (consciousness) on a moment to moment basis. That is, if higher activity of the DMT neurotransmitter system is associated with a greater sense of reality (truth, certainty, importance, etc), and lower activity vice versa, what then regulates DMT activity?",
