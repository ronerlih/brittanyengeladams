With mobile applications and proximity technologies like bluetooth beacons, and LTE Direct (LTED), synchronized campaigns will harmonize the media noise and offer deeper engagement, re-engage in a public space, respond to a call to action on their phones, and connect the dots with attribution in a retail store. The emergence of LTED and proximity technologies will also bring the context and intelligence of digital advertising to the real world. And it’s going to change the mobile, retail, and out-of-home industries forever.",

The body is obscured and is fading as if disintegrating into the background of the scene. (a blending quality as if a statue in ruins) For example, only the sternum and hands would be made visible. This google image, has the general resemblance to the quality of blending, tweaking, and manipulating the visual in different ways.",

By (re)presenting the gestures that were her own necessary precondition, (i.e.those of her relatives) the artist forms a togetherness that transcends the self as a discreetly positioned thing in space-time and (re)supposes a possibility of experience both contingent upon and in excess to the phenomenal and causal.’",

In many ways, these online platforms brought more diverse groups from the dance community together, and gave dance institutions the opportunity to ask and receive feedback from the community. For instance, inviting the public to a special artist talk sessions to discuss and share ideas about the role of art, and performance, welcoming their interpretation of works of art, promoting equality between people and universal access to culture. This discussion addressed topics such as: Are these spaces really open to everyone, or are there people who may feel excluded?  Dance institutions and performance venues with free access are more equal? What should Dance institutions be like in the ‘new normal'.",
