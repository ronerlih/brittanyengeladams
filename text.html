                <p>
                    I’ve been performing for other people my whole life. I find myself wondering how I move?—or how’d I
                    like to move my body? I know how to move for somebody else. I know how to be a virtuosic modern
                    dancer and get the leg-up––or a post-modern dancer, understated and pedestrian like Judson dance
                    theater.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in creating new forms of representation for dance that reflect and value the
                    histories and experiences collected in my body. I am re-imagining new ways of being represented on
                    the stage. I feel like I need to refuse<a class="text-primary" name="origin-02"
                        href="#footnote-02"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a> the ways I’ve been expected to move,
                    think,
                    perform and behave in order to do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first dances I made were with my sister. We would appropriate material from the songs and the
                    dances we observed on television, radio, movies, etc. We would host performances at our home,
                    performing for family members like my mom and grandparents, sometimes even charging a <a
                        name="origin-01" href="#footnote-01">fee</a>
                    for admittance. We created songs like “Dixie-ba-boo” which is about our beloved cat Dixie, using the
                    melody from the “Cruella Deville Song” sourced from the 101 Dalmatians Movie. We would make dance
                    routines or sometimes improvise movements to go along with the songs.
                    Once my sister Anya received a video camera for Hanukkah and so we became movie makers.
                    <a name="origin-01" href="#footnote-01">Reenacting</a> scenes from Jerry Springer, or writing
                    scripts for scary movies or stories
                    about a problem child. Inviting our friends to play the roles of these imagined characters. My
                    sister would usually act as a director to the films, and I would play the most eccentric, wild,
                    off-ball character in the story—these <a name="origin-01" href="#footnote-01">roles</a> seemed
                    fitting.
                    It’s interesting to think about how my current studio practice resembles the ones from my
                    adolescence. My sister and I riffed on the things we were seeing and hearing by repeating or
                    remixing them in new ways.
                    I think what has changed the most about my studio practice from then to now is its ability to be
                    reflective because of the role writing plays in my process. The writings are reflections of the
                    practice. Sometimes they help to map out what happened. But I like to think of it as a way of
                    documenting my activities. <a name="origin-01" href="#footnote-01">Like a journal or diary.</a>

                        <strong>Artist statement</strong>
                        <p>
                            An artist statement is an artist's written description of their work. The brief verbal
                            representation is for, and in support of, their own work to give the viewer
                            understanding.(from "Wikepedia",the free encyclopedia)

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’m hesitant about writing an artist statement and committing to it. What I’m saying is
                            temporary. What I’m saying is constantly changing, I’m constantly changing and in flux. I
                            cannot commit to this statement in a week from now. That is the only way I can commit to
                            what I’m saying right now. I can commit to not committing to an artist statement.

                            Non·com·mit·ment: a failure or refusal to commit to someone or something.
                            Re·fus·al: an act or an instance of refusing; the state of being refused.
    
                            I am refusing committing to an artist statement, accepting teaching re-appointments and
                            long-standing performance projects. These acts of refusals are a protest against people and
                            institutions that have undervalued my work and what I represent.
    
                            These acts of refusals are like breakdowns––It's an existential crisis, it's a cry-out, its
                            hysterical––but most importantly cathartic.
    
                            I recall a time when I ‘d been rejected by a school administrator to be considered for an
                            advancement in the department at my job before any of my materials were reviewed.
                            One semester, I was told I did not receive a teaching re-appointment proposal because it had
                            been assumed that I was pregnant and not returning.
                            My abilities are constantly being undermined and underscored by the way I look or how I’m
                            expected to act.

                            A choreographer asked me to wear my hair in an afro and perform Cunningham vocabulary to
                            Ethipoean pop-music. This was during the process of deconstructing several works of Merce
                            Cunnigham. It was intended to “help me come out of my shell” and it was also assumed that I was
                            Ethipoean (which I am not) I performed this role for many years.
    
                            I often feel misinterpreted and misunderstood by others. Like im screaming and no one can hear
                            me. Muted to the world.
                            Sometimes it's a feeling of being a stranger in my own body.
                            A feeling of not belonging. Not belonging to these associations.

                        My body reacts to the environment and has the potential to become something else, something
                        novel. I can become the figure of my own imagination.


                        12/3/2019:
                        I can make myself invisible in order to not be objectified. To become invisible is like hiding
                        from the cat call. It’s a way to disappear and to avoid a certain type of (unwarranted)
                        attention.

                        On the train today, I could feel the man sitting across from me staring and it made me feel
                        uncomfortable.
                        My body felt penetrated by his fixed gazed.
                        My body experienced a visceral violation even though we did not touch.
                        I decided to reorient my body in the subway setting in order to avoid discomfort.
                        I imagined I was becoming the firm orange fiberglass seat on the subway.
                        I was the seat momentarily.
                        I willingly became an object in order to avoid being objectified.
                        I disappeared and became camouflage.
                        Camouflage is a defense mechanism. I can make myself invisible in order to not be objectified.

                        I use the story of an “aggressive” coyote to describe the ecology of New Brunswick NJ. An
                        “aggressive” coyote was spotted roaming the streets of New Brunswick. This coyote had allegedly
                        bitten a couple of people.
                        New Brunswick NJ is surrounded largely by Rutgers University. I teach in the Dance department on
                        the Douglass campus.
                        I did not see the coyote; I’d only been receiving emails from Rutgers administrators and local
                        law enforcement. They were monitoring the activities of the coyote for weeks.
                        The subject of these emails were titled – “Aggressive Coyote.” My reaction was that of concern
                        for the coyote. The animal had clearly found itself in a foreign place. Displaced from its
                        natural habitat. Though these factors did not seem to be considered, especially to those
                        relaying the news. The news carriers seemed to intend on instilling threat and fear – deeming
                        the animal “aggressive” like a criminal. As if there is a normal type of behavior or response
                        for a wild animal to portray or enact—especially in unsuitable environments that are unfit for a
                        coyote.
                        Why didn’t a local wildlife representative intervene?—
                        Why was there no one to care for or consider the well-being of this living creature?
                        I imagined it was lost, frightened and driven out by a shrinking wilderness, with nowhere to go.
                        In many ways, I can relate to the unintelligible creature and the overwhelming effects a toxic
                        ecology has on behavior and feelings of unbelonging.
                        Today, it was confirmed, the fate of the coyote.
                        It did not have rabies to justify erratic behavior.
                        The coyote had been shot by a local New Brunswick police officer. No more “aggressive” coyote.
                        Problem solved?
